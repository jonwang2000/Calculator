#Calculator

This is meant to be a side project to help me apply practical skills while learning, although hopefully it will be a functional project by the end.

### TODO:
* Redid design
* **Learn Javascript to put together the actual calculator part**
* Build functions for basic math operations (+ - X /)
* Output to header
* Order of Operations
* *More later, I guess*
