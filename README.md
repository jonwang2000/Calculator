# ResponsiveCalculator

The goal of this project is to create a calculator that is responsive on all screens using a combination of css-grid and javascript.

This is meant to be a side project to help me apply practical skills while learning, although hopefully it will be a functional project by the end.

### TODO:
* ~~Create HTML/CSS Files~~
* ~~Build basic structure~~
* **Learn Javascript to put together the actual calculator part**
* Build functions for basic math operations (+ - X /)
* Output to header
* Order of Operations
* *More later, I guess*
