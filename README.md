# Calculator

This is meant to be a side project to help me apply practical skills while learning, although hopefully it will be a functional project by the end.

### Status:

As of Dec 2 the Calculator is functional, although I'd like to improve on it later.

### Todo:

* Improve design
* Maybe make responsive?

### Issues:
* Right after completing an operation, the next button pressed doesn't reset the display, instead it iterates on the result
    * Actually maybe this isn't an issue? Seems kind of useful actually
* Maybe implement a Boolean later
